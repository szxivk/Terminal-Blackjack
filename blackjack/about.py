ABOUT_TEXT = """Welcome to a simplified version of Blackjack!

Hit rock bottom, here as well? We don't accept credit cards. To earn more chips, you have to prove your intelligence by answering Trivia or custom MCQs. Smart plays pay bills!

IMPORTANT: NEVER GAMBLE IN REAL LIFE. The real world doesn't have a "Trivia for Cash" button. You will just lose your house. Keep it in the terminal, folks."""

RULES_TEXT = """▸ THE GOAL: Get closer to 21 than the dealer without going over.

▸ CARD VALUES: 
  • Numbers = their face value (a 5 is worth 5)
  • Face cards (J, Q, K) = 10
  • Aces = 11 or 1 (they're flexible like that)

▸ HOW TO WIN:
  • Beat the dealer's hand without busting (going over 21)
  • Or just wait for the dealer to bust
  • Push = tie. You get your chips back.

▸ THE DEALER'S SIMPLE LIFE:
  • Hits on 16 or below
  • Stands on 17+
  • One card is hidden until you finish your turn.

▸ YOUR OPTIONS:
  • HIT = Take another card (risky business)
  • STAND = Stop and pray
  • SURRENDER = Give up for half your bet back (first move only)

▸ ACE MAGIC:
  • Starts as 11, but if you bust, it becomes 1
  • Multiple aces? Each one can be 11 or 1 as needed
  • It's basically the game doing the math for you. You're welcome.

▸ PRO TIP: The house always wins... eventually. But hey, at least you're not losing real money!"""
